# A way of storing 💾  the data needed by the hosting applications

<v-clicks>

- KISS 
  - Just a big disk in the server you are using to run the thing
- YAGNI, but you'll learn a ton in the process 
  - A Distributed filesystem cluster like Ceph or IPFS
- A balanced option
  - A dedicated NAS, Off-the-shelf or custom
- Something that I'd really want to test in the near future
  - [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/), an OS distributed S3-compatible object storage that runs in crappy hardware
- [QUESTION TO THE AUDIENCE] Any others?

# A way of connect with your hosted applications 🛜

<v-clicks>

- KISS
  - Tailscale
- YAGNI, but you'll learn a ton in the process 
  - Your custom connectivity solution. Some options:
    - OpenVPN based setup
    - Custom router based setup with a Firewall, port fordwarding, https certificates, etc.
    - WireGuard custom zerotrust solution 
- [QUESTION TO THE AUDIENCE] Any others?

# Lessons learned 📝

<v-clicks>

- Enjoy the journey! 
- Full public cloud disconnection is not realistic: Keep one copy of the important data in the ☁
- A homelab is not PROD
- But, your children don't give a 💩 about it. MAKE it SOLID
